# Drawing Machine

A couple of small changes to [Alex Weber](https://twitter.com/9600baud)'s wonderful [Der Kritzler](http://tinkerlog.com/2011/09/02/der-kritzler/) ([github repo](https://github.com/tinkerlog/Kritzler)): a software and hardware platform for developing wall plotters. It consists of a set of Processing sketches and Arduino firmware. 

## Changes

I've ported the original processing from an eclipse project to run in regular [Processing](http://processing.org) app (v1.5). (N.B. you'll need to use the libraries designed for v1.5).

I use a different hardware setup, so I've removed some of the original elements.

## Components

I'm using:

* Sparkfun's [Stepper Motor](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9238) (x2)
* Sparkfun's [EasyDriver Stepper Motor Driver](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9402) (x2)
* Neoprene Timing Belt [McMaster #6484K522](http://www.mcmaster.com/nav/enter.asp?partnum=6484K522) (x2)
* Acetal Pulley for XL-Series Timing-Belt [McMaster #57105K13](http://www.mcmaster.com/nav/enter.asp?partnum=57105K13) (x2)
* Ball Bearings [McMaster #6383K11](http://www.mcmaster.com/nav/enter.asp?partnum=6383K11) (x2)
