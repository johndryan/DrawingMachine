# Drawing Machine

A drawing machine based's on [Alex Weber](https://twitter.com/9600baud)'s wonderful [Der Kritzler](http://tinkerlog.com/2011/09/02/der-kritzler/) ([github repo](https://github.com/tinkerlog/Kritzler)): a software and hardware platform for developing wall plotters. It consists of a set of Processing sketches (see src/ folder), Arduino firmware  (firmware/ folder) and some electronics (some files in the design/ folder). 

## Changes

I've ported the original processing from an eclipse project to run in regular [Processing](http://processing.org) app (v1.5). (N.B. you'll need to use the libraries designed for v1.5).

I use a different hardware setup, so I've removed some of the original elements.
